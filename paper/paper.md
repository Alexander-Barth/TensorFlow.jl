# Summary
TensorFlow.jl is the Julia ([@julia2014]) client library for the TensorFlow framework ([@tensorflow2015],[@tensorflow2016]).
TODO TALK ABOUT IT HERE

 - Making use of julias meta programming
    - `@tf` for node names
    - generating code for operations
 - `getindex` support, `hcat`/`vcat` support
 - duck typing
 - Balance between idomatic julia, and being close to python tensorflow API

 


Julia also has bespoke machine learning frameworks such as Mocha ([@mocha2014]),  Knet ([@knet2016) and Flux ([@flux2018]).
As well as bindings to other frameworks such as MxNet ([@mxnet2015]).

TODO SAY WHY THIS IS DIFFERENT (lots of good reasons)
